# jsPassGenerator

I collaborated with Devin Clark and Jacob Carcerano on this project

This is a password generator using javascript, It contains a scetion to choose the parameters you want for your password including a choice of a minimum of 8 characters and a maximum of 128 characters, uppercase letters, numbers and symbols.

This was a grueling task considering I am quite behind on my modules, but i'm glad I was able to work with the friends I have in this course. We all contributed a fair amount to this project and we all couldnt have done it without the help of each other. My knowledge on this subject is still minimal but the only way to go from here is up.

One of the main motivators for me was trying to learn the code because javascript is one of the most widely used coding languages. I could make a career off of this one coding language if need be, javascript will sooner or later be one of the main foundations to my coding knowledge.
